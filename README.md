# Course Project: Getting and Cleaning Data

This project was completed for the Coursera and Johns Hopkins University course “Getting and Cleaning Data”, part of the Data Science Specialization track. The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set.

The data for this project come from the [Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones).

## Project Requirements

Create an R script that does the following:

1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

## R Code

Run the file run_analysis.R to download the dataset, tidy the data, perform summary statistics, and save a tidy data set as tidy_data.txt.

## Code Book

The code book describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work performed to clean up the data.
